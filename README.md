# Rain Prediction Project

# üå¶Ô∏è Australian Weather Prediction Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project leverages the **Rain in Australia dataset** (sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, via Kaggle) to develop a **binary classification model** predicting whether it will rain tomorrow (**RainTomorrow: Yes/No**). The solution combines **data science, machine learning, and domain-specific analysis** to support industries where weather forecasts are mission-critical.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Approach

1. **Data Preparation**

   - Cleaned daily weather data from multiple stations.
   - Handled missing values/outliers, normalized continuous variables.
   - Feature engineering: lag variables, humidity ratios, seasonal encodings.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Correlation analysis of temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
   - Seasonal and geographic rainfall distribution visualizations.

3. **Model Development**

   - Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
   - Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.
   - Evaluation with **cross-validation** and **ROC-AUC, F1, Precision/Recall** metrics.

4. **Deployment & Delivery**
   - Predictions delivered via **dashboard + API**.
   - Visualizations: interactive charts, rainfall probability maps.
   - MLOps: retraining schedule, drift monitoring.
